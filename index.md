### Visualizing Bike Patterns + Modifying Pricing Strategy for Citi Bike
The goal is to increase revenue and decrease bike shortages at stations across Manhattan. Developed interactive map using Leaflet to highlight asymmetric traffic routes and stock levels in real-time. Created pricing scheme recommendation based on the stock level amount in a quantile function.

### Investigating Staff Turnover using Regression and Machine Learning
Examined survey results to understand workforce attrition and cluster employees based on income level, education field, frequency of business travel, years at the company, etc. Analyzed logistic regression and ten machine learning models to predict turnover with 91% accuracy and proposed improvements to retention and recruiting processes.

No: employee did not leave the company | Yes: employee did leave the company

### Hypothesis Testing on Opioid Overdoses to Advocate for Narcan Usage
Narcan can be a life-saving medicine to rapidly reverse an opioid overdose in emergency situations. According to the NHTSA, roughly 50% of EMS agencies run at the Basic Life Support level and cannot legally administer intravenous drugs, which includes Narcan. In this project, I wanted to investigate how quickly a patient can die from exposure to fentanyl versus oxycodone with additional analysess considering confounding variables of age and race.

### Parsing Doctors' Notes
In this project I used text processing techniques and metrics like term frequency-inverse document frequency to gather descriptive text statistics and distinguish important words from notes. I looked into questions like "What percentage of notes that mention 'depression' also mention 'pain'?" and vice versa.
